Based on a database with movies , i made a website where i display these movies as a list .
For each movie you can open a "Details" page where you can see more informations about that movie and you can also add comments on that movie . 
I also implemented a search box where you can find a specific movie by name. 

This project is made with .NET CORE 5 MVC
